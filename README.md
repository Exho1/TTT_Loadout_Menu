TTT_Loadout_Menu
================
Created by Exho on August 15th, 2014 and initially coded in 2 hours. Its my clone of a Coderhire addon that I saw. 

Almost entirely rewritten on 7/12/15 to just work better. Added scrollers for more weapons as well as reducing boilerplate code on the client and improving the serverside code as well.


Modified loadout_config.lua to also Show Weapons from the follwoing addons:

[TTT Rifle Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307400737)

[TTT Assault Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307400139)

[TTT Assault Pack 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316433211)

[TTT Shotgun Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307345118)

[TTT Pistol Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307401169)

The Addon can be Downloaded via Steam Workshop [HERE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823291864).
for correct use all previously mentioned addons are required. These can be downloaded [HERE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823275528) as a collection.
